This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tally Demo Form Integration

The signup page supports an embedded Tally form for demo requests.

1. Create a Tally form and copy the share URL. Example: `https://tally.so/r/abc123`
2. Set the form ID in `public/site-config.json`:

```json
{
	"tallyFormId": "abc123"
}
```

This file is loaded at runtime, so for static hosting (for example GitHub Pages) you can change only `site-config.json` and redeploy assets without rebuilding the app.

Optional fallback for local or build-time configuration:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TALLY_FORM_ID=abc123
```

If neither runtime config nor env var is set, the page automatically falls back to an email-based demo request CTA.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
